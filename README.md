# Physics-Informed-Neural-Networks ([Bachelor Thesis](https://github.com/Zador-Pataki/Physics-Informed-Neural-Networks/files/7711682/Physics_Informed_NN.pdf))
Bachelor Thesis on Physics Informed Neural Networks for Identification and Forecasting of Chaotic Dynamics. We investigate the ability of physics informed neural networks
— data-driven neural networks which incorporate laws of physics generally in the form of partial differential equations — to infer the solutions of and to identify a number of nonlinear partial differential equations. A relatively simple physics informed neural network framework was created that can be easily adjusted and applied to solve any of the mentioned problems concerning different partial differential equations.
